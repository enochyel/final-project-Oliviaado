# Introduction
This project seeks to detect land cover changes in southern Minnesota. 
Understanding the dynamics of environmental transformations caused by natural processes and human activities requires detecting land cover change. Accurate detection helps inform sustainable land-use policies and mitigate environmental impacts, such as biodiversity decline and climate change. Land cover change detection is a critical tool for understanding the complex dynamics of land use and its impacts on the environment, society, and economy. As human activities, such as urban expansion, agricultural intensification, and deforestation, continue to alter the landscape, it becomes increasingly important to monitor and assess these changes over time. studying land cover changes is vital for understanding environmental, social, and economic systems. It informs policies, promotes sustainable development, enhances disaster resilience, and helps manage natural resources more effectively.This study attempt to answer the principal questions:
-What are the land cover change patterns that have occurred in Southern Minnesota from 2000 to 2020?
-What factors are causing these changes if there has been any change detection?

# Conclusions
In conclusion, detecting land cover changes is essential for comprehensively understanding the impacts of human activities and natural processes on the environment. Through advanced remote sensing technologies and data analysis techniques like R, lannd cover changes are effectively monitor and quantify shifts in land cover over time, providing valuable insights into urbanization, deforestation, agricultural expansion, and climate change. This information is critical for informed decision-making, allowing for the development of sustainable land use policies and effective conservation strategies. As global challenges such as biodiversity loss, climate change, and resource depletion intensify, continuous monitoring and detection of land cover changes will be pivotal in ensuring a balance between human development and environmental preservation, ultimately fostering a more resilient and sustainable future for the planet.

Clear summary adequately describing the results and putting them in context. Discussion of further questions and ways to continue investigation.
From the analysis of the results, it was found that there has been a change detection in almost all the seven(7) landcovers. The developed area/built environment experienced a significant level of incremental changes. From 2000 to 2020, developed areas grew from 16.2% to 19.2% whereas there was a significant decrease in croplands from 29.2% to 26.9%. All the other landcovers(wetland, grasslands, and barren lands increased at 16.6%-16.7%, 14.1%-14.6,0.1%-0.2% respectively while open waters and forest decreased from 4.3%-4.1%, 18.7%-18.4% respectively. These findings indicate that vegetative covers are been lost to the built environment. In future, I will want to study land surface temperature to investigate if loss of vegetative covers give rise to urban heat island.
